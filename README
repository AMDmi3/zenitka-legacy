              zenitka - excessive paratrooper clone
             =======================================

History
~~~~~~~
Zenitka is a game by Ilia Piljev, originally written for Windows
in Delphi/DelphiX. The last version was released in 2002, then the
website was closed, and the game nearly forgotten. In 2006, I've
obtained game source code from author with intention to rewrite the
game in portable way using cross-platform libraries. Now, behold
the result. Code is rather ugly, as I've just rewritten Delphi code
in C, to copy game behavior 1:1, but I hope to improve code quality,
as well as turn Zenitka into complete game.

PS. `Zenitka' means `air-defence gun' in Russian :)
